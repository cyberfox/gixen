<h2>Gixen API Library</h2>

This is a simple library to allow access to the "Gixen API":http://www.gixen.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=9186 for setting and deleting eBay snipes.

In order to use the Gixen API, you must be a paid user of "Gixen Mirror":http://www.gixen.com/ but it's a VERY inexpensive site.

Documentation is "available here":Gixen.html if you're already on the "Gixen API project's RDoc.info page":http://rdoc.info/projects/cyberfox/gixen

Enjoy!
