<h2>Gixen API Library</h2>

This is a simple library to allow access to the Gixen API for setting and deleting eBay snipes.

In order to use the Gixen API, you must be a paid user of Gixen, but it's a VERY inexpensive site.

Documentation is <a href="http://docs.github.com">available here</a>.

Enjoy!
